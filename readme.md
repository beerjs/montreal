Why BeerJS Montreal?
--------------

Montreal has a great tech-scene, but after attending some events as a new resident of the city I thought there was room for another event to bridge the gap between 'networking', learning, and socializing. With beer as the secret ingredient maybe we can do all three at the same time!
